I&#39;m currently working as a web developer while working on HITMAPS in my spare time.</p><p data-v-4dc5aa80>I started working on HITMAPS a month or so before HITMANâ„¢ 2 was released, as I was not seeing any progress made on hitmanmaps.com. By building a site that allows outside contributions, maps for all six starting locations were created far faster than I could ever imagine.</p><h3 data-v-4dc5aa80>Are you Affiliated With IO Interactive or HITMANâ„¢ Maps?</h3><p data-v-4dc5aa80>Nope. Not at all. hitmanmaps.com was created by Winterbirds, which heavily influenced HITMAPS, as I wanted to provide a similar user experience to what hitmanmaps.com users were used to using. However, I&#39;ve never spoken to the creator of hitmanmaps.com.</p><h3 data-v-4dc5aa80>Special Thanks</h3><p data-v-4dc5aa80>I&#39;d like to thank the following for making HITMAPS what it is today:</p><div class="row" data-v-4dc5aa80><div class="col" data-v-4dc5aa80><div class="media" data-v-4dc5aa80><img src="'+H+'" alt="IO Interactive Logo" class="align-self-start mr-3" height="64" width="64" data-v-4dc5aa80><div class="media-body" data-v-4dc5aa80><h5 class="mt-0" data-v-4dc5aa80><a href="https://www.ioi.dk" target="_blank" data-v-4dc5aa80>IO Interactive</a></h5><p data-v-4dc5aa80>Without them, the Hitman series would not exist, and therefore this site would not exist.</p></div></div><div class="media" data-v-4dc5aa80><img src="'+A+'" alt="Readme.io Logo" class="align-self-start mr-3" height="64" width="64" data-v-4dc5aa80><div class="media-body" data-v-4dc5aa80><h5 class="mt-0" data-v-4dc5aa80><a href="https://www.readme.io" target="_blank" data-v-4dc5aa80>ReadMe</a></h5><p data-v-4dc5aa80>ReadMe provides a free open-source license to document HITMAPS&#39; public API.</p></div></div></div><div class="col" data-v-4dc5aa80><h5 data-v-4dc5aa80>The Community</h5><p data-v-4dc5aa80>The community is vital to HITMAPS.
